<h2>Avengers</h2>
<p>
The Avengers play a central role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's Infinity Saga,
being the focus in multiple feature films, beginning with the eponymous 2012 live-action film,
The Avengers, and followed by the sequels Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015),
Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019),
the latter two of which were based on "The Infinity Gauntlet" storyline.
The Avengers were featured in Captain America: Civil War (2016),
which was loosely based on the "Civil War" storyline.
They also appeared in the mid-credits scene of Captain Marvel (2019),
set immediately after Infinity War and before Endgame.
